        In an ideal world, all dog food would be created equal.
         Instead, dog owners are presented with an overwhelming array of options,
          all claiming to be the best dog food on the market. Wading through these 
          choices to find a dog food brand that is healthy, affordable, and 
          appealing to your pet is often frustrating. We’ve compiled expert 
          advice to help you narrow down your options.

    <h1 style=" text-align:center; color: #e4630d">What Makes a Dog Food “Good”?</h1>
    <p>
        Most people feed their dogs dry kibble or canned wet food. 
        These processed foods might not be appealing to us, but they
         contain all of the nutrients dogs need to stay healthy. 
         Quality commercial dog foods are highly regulated and 
         have undergone rigorous testing by veterinary specialists.
          So what exactly is in these dog foods?
    </p>
    <p>
        Dogs, unlike cats, are not strict carnivores. While meat makes up the majority of their diet, domestic dogs can also derive nutrients from grains, fruits, and vegetables. These non-meat foods are not simply fillers, but can be a valuable source of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. A good dog food will contain meat, vegetables, grains, and fruits. The best dog foods contain high-quality versions of these ingredients that are appropriate for your dog’s digestive system.
    </p>
    <h1 style=" text-align:center; color: #e4630d ">Dog Food Nutrition</h1>
    <p style=" text-align:center; ">
        The best dog food for your canine companion should meet his nutritional needs. While most commercial dog food brands are specially formulated with at least the minimum nutritional requirements for dogs, it is important to remember that not every dog has exactly the same nutritional needs.
    </p>
    <p >
        Dogs require a wide range of nutrients in different quantities over the course of their lives. The nutritional needs of a puppy are different from an adult dog, which is why it is a good idea to feed a puppy formula or an “all life stages” food to your young dog. If you are unsure about the differences in nutritional requirements between puppies and adults, the Merck Veterinary Manual lists the recommended nutrients for dogs, along with the recommended amount by weight and age. Large breed dogs and puppies have different nutritional requirements than small breed dogs and puppies.
    </p>
    <h1 style=" text-align:center; color: #e4630d">Product Name</h1>
    <p>
        The product name alone tells you a lot about what’s inside the can or bag. The term “beef” means that beef must make up at least 70 percent of the entire product. The terms “beef dinner,” “beef entrée,” or “beef platter,” on the other hand, only require that beef makes up at least 10 percent of the entire product. “With beef” only requires that 3 percent of the total product be beef, and “beef flavor” simply implies that there is enough beef in the product to flavor it (less than 3 percent). The same holds true for other named ingredients like “chicken.”
    </p>
    <h1 style=" text-align:center;  color: #e4630d">Ingredients</h1>
    <p >
        The ingredient list on a dog food label will not tell you the quality of the ingredients or where they came from, and some manufacturers split up the ingredients to make the distribution more equal. For instance, different types of corn, such as flaked corn, ground corn, or kibbled corn, can be listed separately. This bumps corn down on the list of ingredients, even though the actual content of corn in the food is high. Meat is another tricky ingredient. Whole meats contain a large percentage of water weight, which means that the overall percentage of meat after processing is lower than it appears. Meat meal, on the other hand, sounds less appealing to people, but actually contains more meat than “whole meats,” as there is no water weight to throw off the calculation.
    </p>
    <p >
        While the ingredient list might not tell you the quality of the ingredients, it does tell you what is in the food. This is especially important for dogs with special dietary needs or allergies and is also useful for owners who wish to feed their dogs specific sources of fiber, protein, and carbohydrates.
